# Project Idea: Recipe generator based on available ingredients

This project should allow the user to input ingredients available to them, or ones they wish to cook with, and it should correlate them to existing recipes from an API. It's often hard to think of what to cook, or it can be daunting to find recipes of appropriate levels of difficulty, so the goal of this project is to facilitate this process. On top of that, some more features are detailed below.


## General Features:
* Provide Recipes based on given ingredients, desired complexity, cooking style/preferences, and time constraints.
* Allow an option that is budget-friendly, possibly for students
* Show where to get nearby ingredients
* Can input preferences -> Create a profile, add basic info, etc.
* Profiles can be accessed through third-party authentication and they are stored in a database.
* Can save favorite recipes (they can also be stored in a database).

## APIs could be:
* Spoonacular: https://spoonacular.com/food-api
* Recipe API: https://rapidapi.com/blog/recipe-apis/
* List of APIs: https://suggestic.com/blog/recipe-api-ultimate-list


# Alternative Project: Restaurant/Food Recommender

This project should search from an API that details enarby restaurants, and select recommendations based on different parameters. It could focus on reviews, mood of the user (either given or allowed to be analyzed through some method, like music, text/tweets, etc.), upcoming festivities, patterns in what they like or frequented places, new/popular places, etc. Depending on how detailed the user would like the experience to be, it could range from recommending a cuisine, a cooking style, a restaurant, or even a particular dish. It can also allow for the user to provide feedback on the recommendations and rate the place/food.
